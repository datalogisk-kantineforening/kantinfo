kantinfo: a simple infoscreen system
====================================

`kantinfo.py` shows slides in rotation on a screen.  It was originally
developed for the student-driven canteen at [DIKU](https://di.ku.dk/),
but is now also used elsewhere.

See https://github.com/kantinen/infoscreen for the most prominent
infoscreen using the `kantinfo` system.


Content
-------

Supported file types and their corresponding actions:

  * `.html`, `.gif`: Shown in a browser.
  * `.jpg`, `.png`: Shown in an image viewer.
  * `.url`: The URL in the file is either opened in a browser, or in a
    video player, depending on the form of the URL.
  * `.sh`: Is executed.
  * `.eval`: The executable is run, and its output is expected to be
    either a single line with a file path `something.<ext>`, which is
    then displayed according to these rules, or zero lines, which means
    that nothing is shown.
  * `.terminal`: The program is run in a graphical terminal on the screen.


Configuration of slides
-----------------------

Each slide can have a YAML file configuring it.  If a slide is called
`something.ext`, then the corresponding configuration file is located
in `something.ext.yaml` (**not** `something.yaml`, since there can be
both a `something.ext1` and a `something.ext2`).  If no configuration
file exists, then defaults are used.

The following fields are supported:

  * `duration`: Specifies how long to display the slide, in seconds.
    The default value is 20 seconds.  If the `duration` is `-1`, the
    system will not terminate the slide automatically, but rather wait
    for the slide to terminate itself.

  * `show_when`: Specifies when to display the slide.  Should contain
    a Python expression.  Can use the variables `now` of type
    `datetime.datetime`, and `now_timestamp` of type `int`.  Example:
    This will only show the slide on Tuesdays: `show_when:
    now.isoweekday() == 2`

  * `start_at` and `end_at` (both have to be specified, or neither):
    Describes when to display the slide, in a 24 hour clock format.
    Incompatible with `show_when` (performs a subset of the
    functionality of that field).

  * `probability`: Specifies the probability that a slide will be
    shown. Must be in the range 0 to 1.  The default value is `1`,
    meaning that the slides is always shown.

  * `intervals`: For video slides only.  Specifies segments from the
    video, one of which will play when the slide is shown.  Supports
    either timestamps or whole seconds.

  * `start_pos` and `end_pos`: For video slides only.  Specifies what
    part of the video to play when the slide is shown.  Supports either
    timestamps or whole seconds.

Example of a configuration that specifies, that the slide is only shown
for 10 seconds:

    duration: 10

Example of a configuration that specifies, that the slide is only shown
between 13 and 14:

    start_at: 13:00
    end_at: 14:00

Example of a configuation that specifies segments of a video to play:

    intervals: [['0:00' , '0:23'] , ['1:04', '1:30'] , [0, 500]]

Example of a configuation that specifies what part of a video to play:

    start_pos: 0:10
    end_pos: 1:40

or

    start_pos: 41
    end_pos: 100


Command interface
-------------

You can control a running instance of `kantinfo.py`, by running
`kantinfo-order.py`, and giving it commands on standard in.
`kantinfo.py` understands the following commands:

  * `goto_next`: Stop the current slide and go to the next one.
  * `goto <slide>`: Stop the current slide and go to `<slide>`.


Dependencies
-------------

`kantinfo` depends on the following software:

  + `python3`
  + `pyyaml`: YAML library for Python
  + `surf`: Simple browser -- consider using
    https://github.com/Jobindex/surf for nicer transitions between
    slides.
  + `youtube-dl`: video fetcher
  + `feh`: Simple image viewer
  + `lxterminal`: Simple graphical terminal
